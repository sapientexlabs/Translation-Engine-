# Translation-Engine-
The software is a platform where source material  is uploaded for translation, allowing the end-user to pick the appropriate language for the subtitle to be created. Then the content of the video gets translated from one language to another. Currently, English, Italian, German, and Turkish are the languages supported by our software.
